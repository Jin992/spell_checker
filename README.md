# Spell Checker

Complete implementation of SpellChecker class.

Provide functionality:
 * ability to select underlined container: vector, set, unordered_set based on ContainerType value (constructor parameter)
 * load contents of dictionary to memory
 * detect if word is valid (i.e. determine if word should be skipped during spell checking or checked against dictionary)
 * check if word exist in dictionary
 * add word to dictionary-in-memory (that we do not want to be reported as misspelled, e.g. google, variadic)

Notes:
 * dictionary is assumed to be a file containing a list of lowercase words, one per line;
 * each word will contain only lowercase alphabetical characters and possibly apostrophes;
 * from top to bottom, the file is sorted lexicographically, with only one word per line (each of which ends with \n);
 * no word is longer than 45 characters;
 * no word appears more than once

Word is considered invalid if:
 * exceeds maximum length for a word
 * has non alpha characters or begins with apostrophe

The list of files which are allowed to be modified:
* project/spell_check.cpp
* project/spell_check.h
